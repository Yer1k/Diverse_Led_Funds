## Introduction
In this project, we want to explore and create a research paper that seeks to understand the gap between the stated diversity funding, goals and support by corporations relative to their actual level of support to diverse founders. The research will require navigating corporate reporting, media, press releases, etc. and will ultimately become an industry standard with the potential to become a resource and score card for the broader investment industry.
